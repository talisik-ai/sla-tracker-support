# 📊 Project Status Report - PRD vs Implementation
**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Phase:** Post-MVP Enhancement & Refinement
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready & Enhanced

---

## 🚀 Executive Summary

The Jira SLA Tracker has evolved beyond the initial MVP specifications defined in the PRD. We have successfully implemented all core P0 requirements and significant portions of P1 (Enhanced Features), specifically in real-time updates, notifications, and analytics.

Recent efforts (Nov 25-27) focused on **User Experience (UX) refinement** (PWA, Icons) and **Metric Granularity** (Developer Start Times).

---

## 🏆 Key Updates (Nov 25 - Nov 27)

### 1. 🎨 Visual Overhaul & Icons
*   **Icon Migration**: Completely replaced `lucide-react` with **Hugeicons** (Free Pack) across the entire application for a more modern, consistent aesthetic.
*   **Branding**: Updated application branding, favicon, and PWA icons to use the new `sla_dashboard_icon.png`.
*   **Dashboard Polish**: Replaced emoji indicators with professional SVG icons for "Total Issues", "Compliance", "Pending Response", etc.

### 2. 📱 PWA & Native Integration
*   **Install Experience**: Implemented custom "Install App" prompts (`PWAInstallPrompt`) and "New Version Available" banners (`PWAUpdatePrompt`).
*   **Native Notifications**: Integrated Service Worker-based native notifications, allowing alerts even when the app is in the background.
*   **Manifest**: Fully configured `manifest.json` for standalone app experience on mobile and desktop.

### 3. 👥 Developer Performance Enhancements
*   **New Metric: "Time to Start"**: Added a new metric to track the average time taken to move an issue to "In Progress".
*   **Visual Grid**: Updated `DeveloperGrid` and `DeveloperCard` to display this new metric alongside Compliance, Response, and Resolution times.
*   **Logic**: Implemented calculation logic in `developer-performance.ts` (currently using status-based approximation pending full historical data).
